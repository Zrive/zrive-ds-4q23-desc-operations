"TomTom North America, Inc.",https://www.tomtom.com/company/,"If you ever found yourself in a car in the noughties, chances are you’ve used TomTom’s tech.

If you use ride-hailing apps, delivery services, in-vehicle navigation systems – anything that runs on maps or uses location data – chances are you’re still using TomTom’s tech.

The world runs on geolocation data. And the richer and fresher that data is, the further we push the limits of possibility. That’s why we’ve set our sights on something that’s never been done before. The TomTom Maps platform will be the world’s first open mapping ecosystem, collecting the world’s infinite stream of location data into one shared database.

Powered by our industry-spanning partners and a team of talented TomTom’ers, we’re building a map so sophisticated it will update alongside reality – opening up new avenues for innovation. 

It’s an ambitious goal, for sure. But we revolutionized geolocation technology once – we’re ready to do it again. Are you up for the challenge?"
